# Integrate Vela with Your Systems

Connect your existing call recording systems, CRM platforms, and business applications to Vela's analytics platform. This guide shows you how to use our API to automate data flow, build custom integrations, and extend Vela's capabilities to fit your specific business needs.

## What You Can Achieve

With Vela's API, you can:
- **Automate data uploads** from your existing call recording systems
- **Build custom dashboards** that integrate with your business tools
- **Create automated workflows** that trigger actions based on call insights
- **Integrate with your CRM** to enhance customer profiles with call data
- **Develop custom applications** that leverage Vela's analytics

## Common Integration Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Automated Call Recording Upload
**Business Goal**: Eliminate manual data upload and ensure all calls are analyzed

**Use Case**: Your call center uses an existing recording system that stores calls in a database or file system. You want to automatically send all new recordings to Vela for analysis.

**Solution**: Build an integration that monitors your recording system and uploads new calls via API.

### Scenario 2: Real-Time Alert Integration
**Business Goal**: Respond immediately to critical customer issues

**Use Case**: When Vela detects a customer complaint or compliance issue, you want to automatically create a ticket in your help desk system or send an alert to your team.

**Solution**: Use webhooks to receive real-time notifications and trigger your existing workflows.

### Scenario 3: Custom Analytics Dashboard
**Business Goal**: Combine Vela data with other business metrics

**Use Case**: You want to create a custom dashboard that shows call center performance alongside sales data, customer satisfaction scores, and other KPIs.

**Solution**: Use the API to retrieve Vela analytics and combine them with data from other systems.

### Scenario 4: CRM Integration
**Business Goal**: Enhance customer profiles with call insights

**Use Case**: When a customer calls, you want to automatically update their CRM profile with call sentiment, issues discussed, and agent performance.

**Solution**: Use webhooks to receive call completion events and update your CRM system.

## Getting Started with API Integration

### Step 1: Set Up Authentication
1. **Log in** to your Vela platform
2. **Go to "Settings" â†’ "API Keys"**
3. **Generate a new API key** for your integration
4. **Copy the token** for use in your API requests

**Security Best Practice**: Store your API token securely and never expose it in client-side code.

### Step 2: Choose Your Integration Approach

#### Option A: Direct API Integration
**Best for**: Custom applications, automated workflows, real-time data access

**When to use**:
- Building custom dashboards
- Creating automated workflows
- Integrating with existing business systems
- Real-time data processing

#### Option B: Webhook Integration
**Best for**: Event-driven workflows, real-time notifications, automated responses

**When to use**:
- Receiving alerts for important events
- Triggering actions based on call insights
- Real-time notification systems
- Automated ticket creation

#### Option C: Batch Processing
**Best for**: Large data uploads, historical data migration, scheduled updates

**When to use**:
- Migrating existing call data
- Scheduled data synchronization
- Bulk data processing
- Offline data upload

## API Fundamentals

### Base URL
All API endpoints use this base URL:
```
https://api.botlhale.xyz/v1
```

### Authentication
Include your API token in all requests:
```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN_HERE
```

### Rate Limits
- **Standard Plan**: 100 requests per minute
- **Professional Plan**: 500 requests per minute
- **Enterprise Plan**: 1000 requests per minute

**Pro Tip**: Implement exponential backoff for rate limit handling to ensure reliable integration.

## Core API Use Cases

### Uploading Call Data Automatically

#### Use Case: Call Recording System Integration
**Business Need**: Automatically analyze all calls from your existing recording system

**Implementation**:
1. **Monitor your recording system** for new files
2. **Upload via API** when new recordings are available
3. **Track processing status** to ensure successful analysis
4. **Handle errors** gracefully for failed uploads

**Example Code**:
```python
import requests
import os
from datetime import datetime

def upload_call_recording(file_path, agent_email, call_date):
    url = "https://api.botlhale.xyz/v1/calls/upload"
    headers = {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
    
    data = {
        "org_id": "your_org_id",
        "agent_email": agent_email,
        "call_date": call_date.isoformat(),
        "file_url": file_path
    }
    
    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)
    return response.json()
```

### Retrieving Analytics Data

#### Use Case: Custom Dashboard Integration
**Business Need**: Build a custom dashboard that combines Vela analytics with other business data

**Implementation**:
1. **Retrieve agent performance** data via API
2. **Get call analytics** for specific time periods
3. **Combine with other data sources** (CRM, sales, etc.)
4. **Display in custom dashboard**

**Example Code**:
```python
def get_agent_performance(agent_id, start_date, end_date):
    url = f"https://api.botlhale.xyz/v1/agents/{agent_id}/performance"
    headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN"}
    
    params = {
        "start_date": start_date.isoformat(),
        "end_date": end_date.isoformat()
    }
    
    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers, params=params)
    return response.json()
```

### Real-Time Event Processing

#### Use Case: Automated Alert System
**Business Need**: Receive immediate notifications when important events occur

**Implementation**:
1. **Set up webhook endpoint** in your system
2. **Configure Vela webhooks** for specific events
3. **Process incoming events** in real-time
4. **Trigger appropriate actions** (create tickets, send alerts, etc.)

**Example Webhook Handler**:
```python
from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/webhook/vela', methods=['POST'])
def handle_vela_webhook():
    event = request.json
    
    if event['event'] == 'call.completed':
        # Process completed call
        call_data = event['data']
        
        # Check for customer complaints
        if call_data['sentiment'] == 'negative':
            create_support_ticket(call_data)
            
        # Update CRM with call insights
        update_customer_profile(call_data)
    
    return {'status': 'success'}

def create_support_ticket(call_data):
    # Integrate with your help desk system
    pass

def update_customer_profile(call_data):
    # Update CRM with call insights
    pass
```
