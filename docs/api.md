## Core API Use Cases

### Uploading Call Data Automatically

#### Use Case: Call Recording System Integration
**Business Need**: Automatically analyze all calls from your existing recording system

**Implementation**:
1. **Monitor your recording system** for new files
2. **Upload via API** when new recordings are available
3. **Track processing status** to ensure successful analysis
4. **Handle errors** gracefully for failed uploads

**Example Code**:
```python
import requests
import os
from datetime import datetime

def upload_call_recording(file_path, agent_email, call_date):
    url = "https://api.botlhale.xyz/v1/calls/upload"
    headers = {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
    
    data = {
        "org_id": "your_org_id",
        "agent_email": agent_email,
        "call_date": call_date.isoformat(),
        "file_url": file_path
    }
    
    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)
    return response.json()
```

### Retrieving Analytics Data

#### Use Case: Custom Dashboard Integration
**Business Need**: Build a custom dashboard that combines Vela analytics with other business data

**Implementation**:
1. **Retrieve agent performance** data via API
2. **Get call analytics** for specific time periods
3. **Combine with other data sources** (CRM, sales, etc.)
4. **Display in custom dashboard**

**Example Code**:
```python
def get_agent_performance(agent_id, start_date, end_date):
    url = f"https://api.botlhale.xyz/v1/agents/{agent_id}/performance"
    headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN"}
    
    params = {
        "start_date": start_date.isoformat(),
        "end_date": end_date.isoformat()
    }
    
    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers, params=params)
    return response.json()
```

### Real-Time Event Processing

#### Use Case: Automated Alert System
**Business Need**: Receive immediate notifications when important events occur

**Implementation**:
1. **Set up webhook endpoint** in your system
2. **Configure Vela webhooks** for specific events
3. **Process incoming events** in real-time
4. **Trigger appropriate actions** (create tickets, send alerts, etc.)

**Example Webhook Handler**:
```python
from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/webhook/vela', methods=['POST'])
def handle_vela_webhook():
    event = request.json
    
    if event['event'] == 'call.completed':
        # Process completed call
        call_data = event['data']
        
        # Check for customer complaints
        if call_data['sentiment'] == 'negative':
            create_support_ticket(call_data)
            
        # Update CRM with call insights
        update_customer_profile(call_data)
    
    return {'status': 'success'}

def create_support_ticket(call_data):
    # Integrate with your help desk system
    pass

def update_customer_profile(call_data):
    # Update CRM with call insights
    pass
```
