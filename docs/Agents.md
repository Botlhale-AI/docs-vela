## Daily Agent Management Routine

- **Declining satisfaction** shows worsening performance
- **High satisfaction** with good efficiency = excellent performance

#### Resolution Rate
- **Low resolution rates** suggest training needs
- **High resolution rates** with good satisfaction = strong performance

### Step 3: Create Action Plans

1. **Identify specific weaknesses** from the data
2. **Schedule one-on-one coaching** sessions
3. **Provide targeted training** materials
4. **Set weekly improvement goals**

#### For Average Agents (Score 70-89%)
1. **Focus on strengths** to build confidence
2. **Address specific weaknesses** systematically
3. **Provide peer mentoring** opportunities
4. **Set stretch goals** for improvement

#### For Top Performers (Score 90%+)
