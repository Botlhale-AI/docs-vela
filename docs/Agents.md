# Agents

The Agents screen gives you a complete view of how your agents are performing. It's designed to help you monitor, analyse, and improve your call centre team's performance. You can view the information in either a list or board format - whatever works best for you. Just click the **View** icon in the top right corner to switch between the two.

## Overview

### Understanding the Agent Performance Table

The Agents screen includes the following key elements:

- **Name** – The agent's name
- **Team** – The team the agent belongs to
- **Department** – The department associated with the agent
- **Calls** – The number of calls handled by the agent within the selected date range
- **Score** – The agent's overall performance score (percentage-based), with lower scores indicating a need for improvement
- **Strengths** – The agent's top-performing skills, as identified by the system
- **Weaknesses** – Areas where the agent needs improvement
- **Rank** – The agent's ranking based on performance compared to other agents
- **Detailed View** – Clicking "View" provides an in-depth breakdown of the agent's call history, analytics, and feedback

## Detailed Agent View

The Detailed Agent View provides an in-depth analysis of individual agent metrics. This view includes a scorecard for each agent, which users can download for further analysis. The scorecard includes detailed metrics such as:

- **Call Duration**: The average duration of calls handled by the agent
- **Customer Satisfaction**: The average customer satisfaction score for the agent
- **Resolution Rate**: The percentage of calls resolved by the agent
- **Adherence to Scripts**: The agent's adherence to predefined scripts during calls
- **Missed Customer Cues**: The number of missed customer cues during calls

- **Sort**: Order entries by any table column (except the Detailed View column) to quickly find specific agent performance metrics
- **Filter**: Apply specific criteria based on various parameters to focus your analysis on what matters
- **Export**: Download the entire table as a CSV file for further analysis in your preferred data visualisation or statistical tools
