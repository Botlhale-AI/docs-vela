## Detailed Call View 

The Vela detailed call screen provides a comprehensive interface for in-depth analysis of individual customer interactions. It goes beyond a simple call log by presenting a multi-faceted view of the conversation. 

This screen integrates several key elements: 
- **Full Transcript**: A textual representation of the entire conversation. 
- **Audio Playback**: An audio box allowing you to replay the call recording. 
- **Smart Detector**: This customisable, automated intelligence section leverages advanced natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to generate a concise summary, identify prominent keywords, categorise key issues and customer intents, gauge overall sentiment, and even assess agent performance metrics like adherence to scripts and resolution effectiveness. For more information around setting up this feature, see the [Smart Detector](/docs/smart-detector-overview) section of this documentation.

- **Sentiment** – Analyses the emotional tone of the conversation, categorising interactions as positive, neutral, or negative.
