# Vela Release Notes – Version 1.2

Dear Vela Users,

We’re excited to announce the latest update to Vela! This release brings several new features, improvements, and bug fixes designed to enhance your experience and streamline your workflows. Here’s what’s new and improved:

## New Features

### Organisation Segmentation
This feature introduces greater flexibility for organizing your workforce. You can now structure your organisation into departments, teams, and agents. This makes it easier to upload calls, filter dashboards and reports, and create team-based checklists and searches. You can also view and manage your organisational structure directly in the settings.

### SSO Log-In
Logging into Vela is now more convenient. You can use your Google or Microsoft accounts to access the platform, provided they’re linked to your Vela account.

### Recurring Reports
You can now schedule reports to be generated and delivered automatically at regular intervals. This ensures that key insights are always ready when you need them, without requiring manual input.

### Sending reports to agent
Agent Management
We’ve added more options for managing agents directly from the Agents page. You can edit agent details, delete agents entirely, and even upload multiple agents in one go.

## Improvements

### Historical Checklists
You can now apply newly created checklist questions to past calls. This ensures that your evaluation criteria remain relevant and consistent, even for older data.

### Search Terms Tab
We’ve reorganized Pain Points, Topics, Keywords, and Intents into a new Search Terms tab under Smart Detector. This makes managing these items simpler and more centralized.

### Customisable Reports
Reports can now include your organisation’s logo, making them more polished and aligned with your branding.

### Light Mode and Enhanced Colour Contrast
A new display option allows you to toggle between light and dark modes, depending on your preference or environment. We’ve also introduced better colour contrast for an easier viewing experience.

### Alert Notifications
You can now specify which alerts should send email notifications in real time, giving you more control over the information you receive.

### Deleting Smart Searches & Checklists
You now have the ability to permanently delete smart searches and checklists, helping keep your workspace tidy.

### Organisational Limits
For organisations approaching their package limits, we’ve added better visibility and controls. You’ll see clear messages when limits are reached, and it’s now easier to manage within those boundaries.

### User Segmentation
We've made it easier to manage user permissions within Vela organisations. User and admin views are now segmented by organisational, department, and team levels, ensuring that they only have access to relevant information based on their role.

### Model Accuracy
We've enhanced the accuracy of our multilingual ASR (transcription) models, resulting in greater precision and more dependable transcripts.

## Bug Fixes

### Reports
We’ve fixed an issue where report generation failed for large files or caused formatting problems. Reports now generate reliably, regardless of size.

### Daily Notifications
Resolved an issue where users who selected daily notifications weren’t receiving them correctly. These notifications now arrive as expected.

## What’s Next?

### Checklist Results
We’re introducing more detailed insights into agent performance by breaking down results for specific checklist questions. This will help you better understand strengths and areas for improvement at a granular level.

### Call Outcomes and Reasons
The system will soon provide explanations for certain call outcomes and smart search results, giving you deeper context and understanding behind the data.

### Filtered Historical Checklists and Smart Searches
You’ll be able to apply newly created smart searches and checklist questions to a selected subset of historical calls, giving you greater flexibility and precision when reviewing past performance.

We’re constantly working to make Vela better. Stay tuned for more updates, and as always, we’d love to hear your feedback at product@botlhale.ai.

Thank you for being a valued part of our community!

Warm regards,  
The Vela Team
