# Vela Release Notes â€“ Version 2.1

Dear Vela Users,

We're excited to announce the latest update to Vela! This release brings several new features, improvements, and bug fixes designed to enhance your experience and streamline your workflows. Here's what's new and improved:

## New Features

### Agent Coaching Portal
We've launched a complete coaching portal for agents that includes:
- **Courses Management**: Assign and track training courses with progress monitoring
- **Awards System**: Recognise and reward high performers with digital awards
- **Warnings Management**: Send and manage cautions and warnings to agents
- **Agent Dashboard**: Personalised dashboard showing performance, courses, and achievements
- **Interactive Learning**: Course completion with quizzes and assessments
- **Notifications**: Instant notifications for courses, awards, and warnings


### Knowledge Base
We've added the ability to upload your knowledge base and a well-defined description for your documents into the system. This feature is available as an add-on and will allow Vela to analyse calls more effectively and assess agent performance based on your specific business context.

### Scorecard (Checklist) Results
View the results of the agent scorecard at a question level. Find this on the new Results tab on the Agents Scorecard page in the Smart Detector.

### Smart Search Insights
Vela will now provide explanations for smart search results, giving you deeper context and understanding behind the data.

### Filtered Historical Smart Searches & Scorecards
Apply newly created smart searches and scorecard questions to a selected subset of historical interactions, giving you greater flexibility and precision when reviewing past performance.

### Interactions Section
Chats are now available in Vela! The Calls page has been moved into the new Interactions section, which now includes both Calls and Chats for improved data segmentation.

### Data Upload APIs
The chats API allows clients to send their chat text data to Botlhale for processing on Vela. The call API allows clients to send their call voice data to Botlhale for processing on Vela.

### Interactions Metadata
Include rich interaction metadata when sending and loading your interactions to Vela (manually via the platform's Upload functionality, or automatically via APIs).

## Improvements

### Redaction
We've improved the quality of the redaction model.

### User Segmentation
We've created three classes of admin and user views: Organisational, Departmental and Team. Teams belong to departments, and departments belong to an organisation which houses everything.

### Smart Detector Filtering
We've expanded the filtering capabilities of the smart search and agent checklist tables. Filter by a wider range of table metrics, making it that much quicker to find the search or checklist you're looking for.

### Created vs Detected Smart Search Terms
This improvement allows users to distinguish between smart search terms (topics, intents, and pain points) detected by Vela and those that have been manually created within the platform. This gives you greater transparency and control over your search criteria, allowing you to easily manage and understand the origins of your smart searches.

### Model Accuracy
We've enhanced the accuracy of our multilingual ASR (transcription) models, resulting in greater precision and more dependable insights.

### Checklists are Scorecards
We've renamed Agent Checklists to Agent Scorecards to better reflect their purpose. This new name more accurately represents their role in evaluating agent performance, making it clearer and more intuitive for users.

### UI/UX Improvements
- **Redesigned Modals**: Updated modal components for better user experience
- **Better Visual Design**: Updated styling and layout for improved usability

<!-- ## Bug Fixes -->

<!-- ### Dashboard Configuration
We have resolved an issue that caused dashboard configurations to reset on reload.

### Users Table
We've updated the users page for a better user experience! Now, only the table scrolls horizontally, keeping the rest of the page static for improved navigation and readability. -->

## What's Next?

### Enhanced Coaching Features
We're improving the coaching portal.

### Improving Smart Detector
We're improving Smart Detector.

### Voice ID Notifications
- We'll automatically send emails to agents who have not submitted a sample for Voice ID.

### Vela Redesign
We're continuing to redesign Vela's UI for an even better user experience with:
- Modern design system
- Improved accessibility

### Advanced Analytics
We're adding more analytics and reporting features to help you better understand your team's performance and customer interactions.

We're constantly working to make Vela better. Stay tuned for more updates, and as always, we'd love to hear your feedback at product@botlhale.ai.

Thank you for being a valued part of our community!

Warm regards,  
The Vela Team
