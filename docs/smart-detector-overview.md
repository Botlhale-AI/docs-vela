# Smart Detector Overview

Welcome to Smart Detector on the Vela platform! Smart Detector empowers you to monitor 100% of your customer interactions, regardless of the language spoken, using advanced natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning. This section offers three powerful tools to enhance your call centre operations:

## Core Features

- **Smart Search:** Create and manage automated searches to identify specific topics, intents, keywords, or pain points within call transcripts, enabling deeper insights and proactive issue resolution.

- **Agent Scorecard:** Evaluate and improve agent performance by setting up checklists and tracking key behaviours across interactions.

- **Knowledge Base:** A powerful AI-powered tool integrated into your call centre analytics dashboard. This system enables you to build a searchable, smart knowledge base using your own documents and URLs, delivering relevant insights to your organisation.

## Getting Started

Navigate through these features using the cards on the main **Smart Detector page**, or dive deeper into specific categories like **Topics**, **Intents**, **Keywords**, and **Pain Points** using the labels below the cards. These tools help you analyse calls, uncover trends, and optimise your team's performance with ease.
