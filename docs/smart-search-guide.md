Smart Search is a powerful feature that allows you to create and manage automated searches to identify specific topics, intents, keywords, or pain points within call transcripts. This enables deeper insights and proactive issue resolution.

## Overview

Smart Search uses advanced natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to analyse your call transcripts and identify patterns, compliance issues, and business opportunities.
