### Organizing by Scope
Filter searches to focus on specific areas:

- **Matched phrases** - What triggered the detection
- **Context** - Surrounding conversation for understanding
- **Action taken** - How the issue was resolved

### Interpreting the Data
- **High match rates** - Indicate common issues to address
- **Low match rates** - May need to refine search criteria
- **Patterns over time** - Show trends and improvements
- **Agent-specific results** - Identify individual training needs

## Best Practices for Effective Searches

### Phrase Selection Strategy
- **Be specific** - Use exact phrases customers say
- **Include variations** - Add different ways to express the same thing
- **Test thoroughly** - Verify searches catch the right interactions
- **Update regularly** - Add new phrases as you learn

### Scope and Filtering
- **Start broad** - Monitor organization-wide for major issues
- **Add specificity** - Create targeted searches for specific teams
- **Use filters wisely** - Don't over-filter and miss important matches
- **Review regularly** - Adjust scope based on results and needs

### Notification Management
- **Set appropriate alerts** - Don't overwhelm with too many notifications
- **Escalate important issues** - Ensure critical problems get immediate attention
- **Review notification effectiveness** - Adjust based on response times
- **Balance automation** - Use notifications for important, not all, matches

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Searches Not Finding Matches
**Problem**: Searches aren't detecting expected issues
**Solutions**:
- Review and refine your search phrases
- Check if the scope is too narrow
- Verify that data is being processed correctly

**Solutions**:
- Make phrases more specific and targeted
- Add additional filters to narrow results
- Review and adjust search criteria
- Test searches with sample data

### Missing Important Issues
**Problem**: Important problems aren't being detected
**Solutions**:
