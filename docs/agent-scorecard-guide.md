- **Security protocols** - Were data protection measures followed?
- **Escalation procedures** - Were issues escalated when appropriate?

### Efficiency and Effectiveness
Measure productivity and quality:

- **Call handling time** - Was the interaction appropriately timed?
- **First-call resolution** - Was the issue resolved without escalation?
- **Information accuracy** - Did the agent provide correct information?
- **Process adherence** - Were standard procedures followed?

## Analyzing Performance Results
