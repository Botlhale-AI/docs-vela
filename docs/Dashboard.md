## Understanding Your Dashboard

### Performance Overview
Your dashboard shows comprehensive call analytics data for your selected team and time period. Each metric card displays:
- **Current value** (e.g., average call duration)
- **Trend indicator** (up/down arrows showing improvement or decline)
- **Filter icon** for additional filtering options

### Key Insights to Look For

#### Agent Performance
- **High scores** (90%+) indicate excellent performance
- **Low scores** (below 70%) suggest training opportunities
- **Score distribution** helps identify if issues are isolated or team-wide

#### Call Efficiency
- **Long call durations** might indicate complex issues or inefficiency
- **High silent time** could signal agent uncertainty or system delays
- **Response times** show how quickly your team responds to customers

#### Customer Satisfaction
- **Pain points** reveal what's frustrating customers
- **Sentiment trends** show if satisfaction is improving or declining
