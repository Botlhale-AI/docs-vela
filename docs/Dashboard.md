### Step 2: Choose Your Team

## Understanding Your Dashboard

### Performance Overview
Your dashboard shows comprehensive call analytics data for your selected team and time period. Each metric card displays:
- **Current value** (e.g., average call duration)
- **Trend indicator** (up/down arrows showing improvement or decline)
- **Filter icon** for additional filtering options

### Key Insights to Look For

#### Agent Performance
- **High scores** (90%+) indicate excellent performance
- **Low scores** (below 70%) suggest training opportunities
- **Score distribution** helps identify if issues are isolated or team-wide

#### Call Efficiency
- **Long call durations** might indicate complex issues or inefficiency
- **High silent time** could signal agent uncertainty or system delays
- **Response times** show how quickly your team responds to customers

#### Customer Satisfaction
- **Pain points** reveal what's frustrating customers
- **Sentiment trends** show if satisfaction is improving or declining

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

| **Problem** | **Solution** |
|-------------|--------------|
| **Empty Dashboard** | Check if you have uploaded call data, verify your date range includes data, ensure you've selected the correct team |
| **Missing Metrics** | Click "Customise" to add missing metrics, check if the metric is available for your data, contact support if metrics seem incorrect |
| **Outdated Data** | Refresh your browser, check if new data has been uploaded, verify your date range is current |

## Best Practices

### Save Multiple Dashboards
Create different dashboard views for different purposes:

| **Dashboard Type** | **Focus** | **Use Case** |
|-------------------|-----------|--------------|
| **Daily Operations** | Current performance | Morning check-ins |
| **Weekly Review** | Trend analysis | Team meetings |
| **Monthly Planning** | Forecasting metrics | Strategic planning |

### Use Filters Effectively
- **Date ranges** - Compare different time periods
- **Team filters** - Focus on specific groups
- **Call types** - Analyse different interaction types
- **Agent filters** - Review individual performance

### Set Up Alerts
Configure notifications for important events:
- Agent scores drop below thresholds
- Customer satisfaction declines
- Call volumes spike unexpectedly
