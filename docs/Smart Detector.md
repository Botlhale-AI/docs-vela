# Smart Detector
## Introduction

Welcome to Smart Detector on the Vela platform! Smart Detector empowers you to monitor 100% of your customer interactions, regardless of the language spoken, using advanced natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning. This section offers three powerful tools to enhance your call center operations:


- **Smart Search:** Create and manage automated searches to identify specific topics, intents, keywords, or pain points within call transcripts, enabling deeper insights and proactive issue resolution.

- **Agent Scorecard:** Evaluate and improve agent performance by setting up checklists and tracking key behaviors across interactions.

- **Knowledge Base:** Build and maintain a repository of resources to assist agents, providing quick access to information on common topics, intents, **keywords**, or **pain points** identified in customer interactions.

Navigate through these features using the cards on the main **Smart Detector page**, or dive deeper into specific categories like **Topics**,**Intents**, **Keywords**, and **Pain Points** using the labels below the cards. These tools help you analyze calls, uncover trends, and optimize your team’s performance with ease.

## After Clicking Smart Search
Once you click the **Smart Search** card on the Smart Detector homepage, you’ll be taken to the Smart Search section. This is the central hub for analyzing your call transcripts by creating and managing automated search queries. Here’s what you’ll see and how to get started:

![alt text](../img/screenshots/SDS.png)

After landing on the Smart Search section, you’ll start in the **Smart Searches tab**, specifically on the **View sub-tab**. This screen displays a table of all the automated search queries created within your organization. Here’s a breakdown of what you see and how to interact with this page:

### Understanding the View Sub-Tab Layout
- **Header:** The title "Smart Detector - Searches" confirms you’re in the Smart Search section.
- **Sub-Tabs:** At the top, you’ll see options like View, Create, Examples, and Results. You’re currently on the View sub-tab, which is highlighted (orange).
- **Filter Option:** A dropdown labeled "View: Entire Organization" lets you choose the scope of the searches displayed (e.g., organization-wide or specific teams).
- **Table:** The main content is a table listing all search queries, with the following columns:
    - **Name:** The name of the search query (e.g., "Test Search").
    - **Description:** A brief explanation of what the search looks for (e.g., "The client indicates they have an inquiry about an online order").
    - **Scope:** The range of calls the search applies to (e.g., "Organisation").
    - **Date Created:** When the search was created (e.g., "20/01/2026").
    - **Status: Whether** the search is active or inactive (e.g., "Active" or "Inactive").
    - **Notify:** Indicates if notifications are enabled for this search (e.g., "Yes" or "No").
- **Navigation:** At the bottom, you’ll see pagination controls ("Previous", "Page 1 of 1", "Next") to navigate through multiple pages of search queries if there are more than can fit on one page.
- **Sort and Filter:** Icons labeled Sort and Filter (next to a search bar) allow you to organize and narrow down the list of searches.

 ## Changing the Scope in "View By": From Entire Organisation to Specific Department or Specific Team

The "View By" dropdown in the **Smart Searches** tab (under the **View sub-tab**) lets you change the scope of the search queries displayed in the table. By default, it’s set to **Entire Organisation**, showing all queries across your organization. Here’s how to change it to Specific **Department** or **Specific Team** to focus on searches for a particular department (e.g., Customer Support or Sales) or team (e.g., Billing Team).

  - Example: Check this box to see if any historical calls match your criteria, such as past customer complaints.
8. **Notifications:**
  - Check the Receive notification when detected on calls checkbox to get alerts when the search finds a match in ongoing calls.
  - Example: Check this box to receive a notification whenever a call contains phrases like "I’m not happy with."

## Step 3: Create the Search Query
  - Once you’ve filled out all the necessary fields, click the orange **Create** button at the bottom-right of the form.
  - Your new search query will be saved and, if **Enabled** is checked, it will immediately start monitoring call transcripts based on your settings.

![alt text](../img/screenshots/SSD4.png)

#### Examples
The Examples sub-tab in the Smart Searches tab provides a library of predefined search query templates that you can use as inspiration or enable for your own call monitoring. These templates are designed to help you quickly set up common searches without starting from scratch. Here’s what you’ll see and how to use this sub-tab:

# HOW TO START GUID:

## Step 1: Navigate to the Examples Sub-Tab

  - In the Smart Searches tab, click the Examples sub-tab at the top (next to View, Create, and Results).
  - This opens a table displaying the available predefined search query templates.

![alt text](../img/screenshots/SSD5.png)

## Step 2: Understand the Examples Table
The table lists the predefined templates with the following columns:
- **Name:**
   - The name of the template, such as "Competitor" or "Auto-QA: Identity-Confirmation."
   - Clicking the name takes you to a detailed view of the template, similar to the detailed view of a user-created search query.

![alt text](../img/screenshots/SSD6.png)

When you click on a template name (e.g., "Competitor") in the table of the Examples sub-tab within the Smart Searches tab, you’ll be taken to a detailed view of that predefined search query template. This page, labeled "Smart Search Details," shows the template’s settings and allows you to enable or customize it for your use. Here’s what you’ll see and how to interact with this screen:

![alt text](../img/screenshots/SSD7.png)

- **Name:**
  - Displays the name of the template, such as "Competitor."
  - This field is editable if you choose to customize the template.
- **Description:**
  - Shows a brief description of what the template searches for, such as "Competitor mentions in calls."
  - This field is also editable for customization.
- **Search Scope:**
  - Indicates the range of calls the template would apply to if enabled.
  - In this case, it’s set to Entire Organisation, meaning it would monitor all calls across the organization.
  - A dropdown allows you to change the scope to Specific Department or Specific Team if needed.
- **Example Phrases:**
  - Lists example phrases that the template looks for in call transcripts, such as "Competitor A."
  - Each phrase has a delete icon (a red trash bin) next to it, allowing you to remove phrases if you customize the template.
  - An Add button lets you include new example phrases to refine the search.
- **Filters:**
  - Shows any filters applied to the template.
  - Currently, no filters are set (indicated by the lack of a "+ Add Filter" button in this view, though this option may appear if you enable and edit the template).
  - Filters could include criteria like call duration or additional keywords.
- **Search Status:**
  - Displays whether the template is currently active or inactive.
  - The Enabled checkbox is unchecked by default for templates, meaning the search is not active until you enable it.
You can check this box to activate the template.
- **Notifications:**
  - A checkbox labeled Receive notification when detected on calls indicates whether notifications are enabled.
  - By default, this is unchecked for templates, but you can enable it to receive alerts when the search finds a match in ongoing calls.


# Results
The **Results** sub-tab in the **Smart Searches** tab shows a summary of the matches found by your active search queries, helping you identify calls that meet the criteria you’ve set up. This section explains what you’ll see and how to interact with the results, including the difference between the **Single** and **Compound** views.

## Step 1: Navigate to the Results Sub-Tab
 - In the Smart Searches tab, click the Results sub-tab at the top (next to View, Create, and Examples).
 - This opens a summary view of the results for all active search queries in your organization.

![alt text](../img/screenshots/SSD8.png)

## Step 2: Understand the Results Summary
The **Results** sub-tab displays a list of active search queries with the following details:
**Name:**
  - The name of the search query, such as "Test Search" or "Auto-QA: Online order."
  - This matches the names you see in the View sub-tab.
**Description:**
  - A brief explanation of what the search looks for, such as "Client indicates they have an inquiry about an online order."
  - This helps you quickly recall the purpose of each search.
**Match Count:**
  - A number next to each search query (e.g., "0") indicates how many calls have matched the search criteria.
  - In the screenshot, all searches show "0," meaning no calls have matched these criteria yet.
  - As matches are found, this number will increase, reflecting the number of calls flagged by the search.


## Step 3: Choose Between Single and Compound Views
At the top of the **Results** sub-tab, you’ll see two options: Single and Compound. These determine how the results are displayed:
Single View (currently selected):

  - Shows the results for each search query individually.
  - Each row represents one search query, with its name, description, and the number of matches.
  - Use this view to quickly see how many calls match each search query on its own.
**Compound View:**
  - Combines multiple search queries to show calls that match more than one criterion at the same time.
  - Example: You might see how many calls mention both "competitor" (from the "Competitor Mentions" search) and "online order" (from the "Auto-QA: Online order" search).
  - This view is useful for identifying calls that meet multiple conditions, helping you uncover more complex patterns.


 # Smart Search Results

![alt text](../img/screenshots/SSD9.png)

- **Date Range:**
   - A date range filter at the top (e.g., "01/04/2025 – 22/04/2025") allows you to adjust the time period for the results.
   - Click on the date range to select a different period if needed.
- **Smart Search Details:**
   - Name and Description: Displays the search query’s name (e.g., "Test Search") and description (e.g., "Test Description").
   - Date Created: Shows when the search was created (e.g., "20/01/2025").
   - Status: Indicates whether the search is active or inactive. In this case, a blue "Active" label confirms the search is currently running.
- **Summary:**
   - Period Covered: Shows the date range for the results (e.g., "Apr 01, 2025 to Apr 22, 2025").
   - Total Interactions: Displays the number of interactions (calls) that matched the search criteria (e.g., "0 interactions matched this search").
   - Main Insights: Provides a summary of the results. If there are no matches, it will say, "There are no insights available for this search in the selected time period."
- **Returned Calls:**
   - This section (currently empty) would list the specific calls that match the search criteria, including details like call date, agent, and transcript snippets.
   - Since there are no matches ("0 interactions"), this section is empty.

## Step 2: Confirm the Search Status
- Look at the Status label in the Smart Search Details section.
- A blue "Active" label (as shown in the screenshot) means the search is currently running and monitoring calls.
- If the label says "Inactive," the search is paused and won’t detect new matches until you enable it (you can enable it by going to the View sub-tab,  clicking the search name, and checking the Enabled checkbox in the detailed view).

## Step 3: Check the Status of Other Searches
- To check the status of other search queries (e.g., "Auto-QA: Online order," "Competitor Mentions"), click the Back button at the top-left to return to the Results sub-tab.
- In the Results sub-tab, you’ll see the summary table listing all active search queries (as seen in the previous section).
- Click on another search query name (e.g., "Auto-QA: Online order") to go to its Smart Search Results page.
On that page, look at the Status label in the Smart Search Details section to confirm whether it’s "Active" or "Inactive."
- Repeat this process for each search query you want to check.

#### Returned Calls

On the **Smart Search Results** page for a specific search query (e.g., "Test Search"), the **Returned Calls** section allows you to view and analyze the calls that match the search criteria. This section can be expanded by clicking on its header, revealing a table of matching calls (if any). Here’s what you’ll see and how to interact with this section:

## Step 1: Locate and Expand the Returned Calls Section

- On the Smart Search Results page, find the Returned Calls section below the Smart Search Details section.
- The header "Returned Calls" is clickable and has a small arrow next to it, indicating it can be expanded or collapsed.
- Click on the Returned Calls header to expand the section and view the table of matching calls.

![alt text](../img/screenshots/SSD10.png)

## Step 2: Understand the Returned Calls Table

The Returned Calls section contains a table labeled "Interactions," which lists the calls that match the search query’s criteria. Here’s what you’ll see:

**If No Calls Are Found (Current State)**

- If there are no matches, the table will display a message: "No calls matching the search query found," as shown in the screenshot.
- This means no calls within the selected date range (e.g., "01/04/2025 – 22/04/2025") match the search criteria (e.g., the example phrases or filters   set for "Test Search").
- Possible reasons for no matches:
   - The search criteria are too specific (e.g., the example phrases don’t match common call language).
   - The date range is too narrow (e.g., try expanding it to include more calls).
   - The search scope is limited (e.g., only applies to a small team with few calls).
   - Not enough calls have been processed since the search was activated.

**If Calls Are Found (Populated State)**

If there are matching calls, the table will populate with the following columns:

- **Call ID:**
   - A unique identifier for each call (e.g., "C12345").
   - Clicking the Call ID may take you to a detailed view of the call, including the full transcript and audio (if available).
- **Date:**
   - The date and time the call occurred (e.g., "15/04/2025 14:30").
- **Agent:**
    - The name or ID of the agent who handled the call (e.g., "Agent123").
- **Handle Time:**
    - The duration of the call (e.g., "00:05:32" for 5 minutes and 32 seconds).
**Silent Time:**
    - The amount of time during the call with no speaking (e.g., "00:00:45" for 45 seconds of silence).
- **Topic:**
    - The main topic or category of the call, often auto-detected (e.g., "Complaint").
- **Alerts:**
   - Any alerts triggered by the call, such as "Competitor Mention" or "Escalation Needed."
- **Agent Score:**
    - A performance score for the agent based on the call (e.g., "85/100").
- **Team:**
    - The team the agent belongs to (e.g., "Customer Support").
- **Tags:**
    - Any tags associated with the call for easy categorization (e.g., "Urgent").

## Step 3: Interact with the Returned Calls Table

When the table is populated with matching calls, you can interact with it in several ways:

1. **View Call Details:**
 - Click on a Call ID to view the full details of that call, including the transcript with highlighted phrases that matched the search criteria (e.g., "Test A" from the "Test Search" query).
 - You may also be able to listen to the call recording if audio playback is enabled.

2. **Sort and Filter:**

- Use the Sort and Filter icons above the table to organize the results:
   - Sort: Click the Sort icon (double arrow) to sort by columns like Date, Handle Time, or Agent Score.
   - Filter: Click the Filter icon (funnel) to narrow down the results, such as showing only calls from a specific Team or with a specific Alert.
- Example: Filter by Alert to show only calls with "Competitor Mention."

3. **Search Within Results:**
- Use the search bar above the table to search for specific keywords within the returned calls (e.g., search for "refund" to find calls mentioning that word).

4. **Select and Export:**

 - Use the Select All checkbox to select all calls in the table.
 - Click the Export icon (download arrow) to export the table data to a file (e.g., CSV) for further analysis.
 - Example: Export the list of calls to share with your team for review.

5. **Navigate Pages:**
 -If there are multiple pages of results, use the Previous and Next buttons at the bottom of the table to navigate (e.g., "Page 1 of 1" in the screenshot, but this would change if more calls are found).

 ## Using the Compound View in the Results Sub-Tab
**The Compound view** in the **Results** sub-tab of the Smart Searches tab allows you to combine multiple smart searches to identify calls that match all selected criteria at the same time. This is useful for uncovering complex patterns, such as calls that mention both a competitor and a specific issue. Here’s how to set up and use the Compound view to analyze your call data:

## Step 1: Navigate to the Compound View
- In the **Smart Searches** tab, click the Results sub-tab at the top (next to **View**, **Create**, and **Examples**).
- At the top of the **Results** sub-tab, you’ll see two options: **Single and Compound**.
- Click**Compound to switch** to the compound view (as shown in the screenshot).

![alt text](../img/screenshots/SSD11.png)

## Step 2: Select Smart Searches to Combine

The **Compound** view provides a "Quick Search" section where you can select two or more smart searches to combine:

1. **Smart Search 1:**
  - Click the dropdown labeled Smart Search 1 to see a list of available smart searches.
  - The list includes all active search queries from the View sub-tab, such as "applied," "Auto-QA: Greeting," "Auto-QA: Online order," "Competitor Mentions," "Gradesmatch search," "Payment Arrangement," and "Test Search."
  - Select the first search query you want to include.
    - Example: Choose "Competitor Mentions" to look for calls mentioning a competitor.
2. **Add More Smart Searches:**
- After selecting the first search, a Smart Search 2 dropdown will appear (not shown in the screenshot but part of the workflow).
- Click the Smart Search 2 dropdown and select a second search query.
 - **Example:** Choose "Auto-QA: Online order" to look for calls that also mention an online order inquiry.
- You can continue adding more smart searches (e.g., Smart Search 3) by clicking a "+ Add" button or similar option, depending on the interface.
3. **Apply the Selection:**
- Once you’ve selected the desired smart searches, click an Apply or Search button (not visible in the screenshot but typically present in such interfaces) to run the compound search.
- The system will find calls that match all the selected search criteria simultaneously.

## Step 3: Interpret the Compound Results

After applying the compound search, a table of results will appear below the "Quick Search" section (not shown in the screenshot since the selection is still in progress). Here’s what you’ll see:

- **Table of Matching Calls:**
  - The table will list calls that match all the selected smart searches.
  - Example: If you selected "Competitor Mentions" and "Auto-QA: Online order," the table will show calls where a client mentioned a competitor and had an inquiry about an online order.
  - Columns in the table may include:
    - Call ID: A unique identifier for each call.
    - Date: The date and time of the call.
    - Agent: The agent who handled the call.
    - Handle Time: The duration of the call.
    - Silent Time: The amount of silence in the call.
    - Topic: The main topic of the call.
    - Alerts: Any alerts triggered by the call.
    - Agent Score: The agent’s performance score.
    - Team: The agent’s team.
    - Tags: Any tags associated with the call.

- **No Matches Found:**

- If no calls match all the selected criteria, the table will display a message like "No calls matching the compound search query found."
- This could happen if the criteria are too restrictive or if there aren’t enough calls that meet all conditions.


# Selecting Smart Search 2 in the Compound 

In the **Compound** view of the **Results** sub-tab, you can combine multiple smart searches to find calls that match all selected criteria simultaneously. After selecting the first smart search in the Smart Search 1 dropdown, you’ll proceed to the Smart Search 2 dropdown to add a second search query to the compound analysis. This section explains how to use the Smart Search 2 dropdown, complete the setup, and interpret the results.


## Step 1: Access the Smart Search 2 Dropdown
- Ensure you’re in the Compound view of the Results sub-tab (click Compound at the top if you’re in Single view).
- After selecting a search query in the **Smart Search 1**dropdown (e.g., "Competitor Mentions"), the **Smart Search 2** dropdown will appear below it, as shown in the screenshot.

![alt text](../img/screenshots/SSD12.png)

## Step 2: Select a Second Smart Search

- Click the Smart Search 2 dropdown to see a list of available smart searches.
- The list includes all active search queries from the View sub-tab, such as "applied," "Auto-QA: Greeting," "Auto-QA: Online order," "Competitor Mentions," "Gradesmatch search," "Payment Arrangement," and "Test Search."
- Select the second search query you want to combine with the first one.
  - Example: If you selected "Competitor Mentions" for Smart Search 1, you might choose "Auto-QA: Online order" for Smart Search 2 to find calls where a client mentioned a competitor and had an inquiry about an online order.

## Step 3: Add More Smart Searches (Optional)

- If you want to combine more than two smart searches, look for a "+ Add" button or a Smart Search 3 dropdown that appears after selecting Smart Search 2 (not shown in the screenshot but typical in such interfaces).
- Repeat the process to add additional search queries, such as "Payment Arrangement," to further narrow down the results.
  - Example: Adding "Payment Arrangement" would find calls that mention a competitor, discuss an online order, and indicate a payment arrangement.
## Step 4: Apply the Compound Search

- Once you’ve selected all the desired smart searches (at least two), click an Apply or Search button (not visible in the screenshot but typically present in such interfaces) to run the compound search.
- The system will analyze your call data and return a table of calls that match all the selected search criteria simultaneously.

# Navigating to the Agent Scorecard Section

  -  Choose Manual if the question requires human judgment.
9. Specify Call Types:
   - Use the Apply To checkboxes to determine which calls the question applies to.
     - Example: Check All Calls (as in the screenshot) to apply the question to both inbound and outbound calls.
   - Alternatively, check Inbound Calls or Outbound Calls to limit the scope.
10. Toggle Auto-Fail:
  - Toggle the Auto-Fail switch to "On" if failing this question should automatically fail the agent’s scorecard.
     - Example: Turn Auto-Fail on for critical questions like "Did the agent use inappropriate language?"
  - Leave it "Off" (as in the screenshot) if failing the question should only affect the score without causing an automatic failure.
11. Save the Question:
  - Click the orange Save button (not visible in the screenshot but typically present at the bottom) to create the question.
  - After saving, the question will appear in the View tab’s table and will start being used to evaluate agents (if Enabled is checked).
